# Create a list called available_stock that will contain the following items, its prices and stocks:
# milk - for 4 PLN - 2 available,
# water - for 0.5 PLN - 2 available,
# bread - for 1 PLN - 10 available,
# butter - for 5 PLN - 1 available,
# apple - for 2.1 PLN - 1 available,
# coffee - for 7.5 PLN - 3 available,
# Create a program that:
# Until customer says "done", request what product customer would like to add to the "basket" with the message
#                             "Please select one of the following products or type "done": "
# Hint: use a while loop ("while input is not 'done', ask customer a new product")
# If the product is available, add to the basket and print message "Item added to the basket."
#           Make sure to check the availability of the stock for certain product
#           Example: customer can only buy one butter, because there is only one available!!!!
# If the product is out of stock, print message "Sorry, product out of stock"
# When the customer is done shopping, print a message "End of shopping. Selected items: "
# Print, one item at a time, with it's price, as a check normally shows, example:
# Milk - 4 PLN
# Milk - 4 PLN
# Water - 0.5 PLN
# Apple - 2.1 PLN
# Print the total value of the bill, example:
